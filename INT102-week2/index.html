        This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at
        parties. My father recommends: "Make this the night before so that the  
        flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature before
        you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm."

          Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth
          as possible.

        <li>
          Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are
          incorporated, but still retain some texture.

          Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish
          (optional).
